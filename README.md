# What is FOS?
FOS is an educational OS for Ain Shams University Operating Systems Course, forked and refactored from [MIT Operating Systems Lab 6.828.](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-828-operating-system-engineering-fall-2012/) It was created by [Dr. Mahmoud Hossam](https://github.com/mahossam/) and currently maintained and lectured by [Dr. Ahmed Salah](mailto:ahmed_salah@cis.asu.edu.eg).


# What is this project?
This project involves creating a fully functional operating system in C. It is considered one of the most challenging projects at Ain Shams University, with some students even finding it more difficult than the graduation project due to its complexity.

The project aims to develop a system that manages memory, schedules processes, and ensures protection for shared resources.
